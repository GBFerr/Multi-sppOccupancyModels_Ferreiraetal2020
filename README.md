- Ferreiraetal2020_singleHyper-Param_...: multi-species occupancy model with a single hyperparameter. Used for species-level inference and species richness; Fig 2 (top panel), Fig 3, and Fig 4.

- Ferreiraetal2020_sizeHyper-Param_...: multi-species occupancy model with distinct hyperparameters according to species size (small vs large). Used for group-level (size) inference; Fig 2 (bottom panel).

- Ferreiraetal2020_threatHyper-Param_...: multi-species occupancy model with a distinct hyperparameters according to species threat (threatened vs non-threatened). Used for group-level (threat status) inference; Fig 2 (bottom panel).
